# passgenerator
a python app for create powerful passwords

In this day and age, computers, software, and hackers have become so advanced that simple, old passwords can be easily cracked and can have very bad security and financial consequences for us. There are many times when we decide and try to choose a strong password, but we either do not get bored or it does not cross our minds. A random password generator program helps us to quickly obtain highly complex passwords of any length. Join us in this post to learn how to make a random password maker in Python.
Some sites and apps have a very convenient and fast suggestion system that gives you a very strong password online, but a very good reason to have a password generator is to make sure your password is stored somewhere. It does not and the development of programs or hackers is not stolen. Another application of this code can be that you can use it in the registration section of your software.

Usage :
you just need to install pyqt modoule and run passwordGenerator.py
